# Intro
This project uses Laravel 9 + Vue 3 + Jetstream (Inertia) + Tailwind + Primevue.

# Requirements
- MySQL
- PHP 8^
- Nodejs

# Setup
1. Clone project
2. Create database
3. Clone .env.example to .env
4. Set .env
   5. APP_NAME
   6. APP_ENV=production
   7. APP_KEY - will be generated by php artisan key:generate
   8. APP_DEBUG=false
   9. APP_URL=FULL_URL_OF_YOUR_SITE
   10. DB information
   11. MAILING information (I suggest using Sendgrid provider, only config needed is env file)
5. copy /database/seeders/storage to /storage folder with the command ``cp -r database/seeders/storage ./``
7. run the following in console:
   1. ``composer install``
   2. ``npm install``
   3. ``php artisan key:generate``
   4. ``php artisan storage:link``
   5. ``php artisan migrate:fresh --seed``
8. From seeding you should see in console email and password for superadmin user. It is randomly generated. 
9. May need to adjust folder permissions, check info here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30639174/how-to-set-up-file-permissions-for-laravel
10. If installing with Apache instead of Nginx (Nginx is provided in Laravel 9 docs), can use this tutorial https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-laravel-on-ubuntu-18-04-with-apache-and-php/

# Run project
1. compile js to public folder ``npm run dev``, ``npm run prod`` or ``npm run watch``
2. ``php artisan serve`` (or run on your server)

# Tests
The project has some tests.
- PHPUnit tests ``php artisan test``
- Dusk tests ``php artisan dusk``

# Notes
1. May need to copy primevue icons folder to public...
2. Inertia.reload in store.js - add all essential reloads (which has entity id)
3. There are custom artisan commands: `php artisan make:crud [CrudName]`, e.g., `php artisan make:crud Account`. 
   1. However,you should reseed data so there are permissions.
